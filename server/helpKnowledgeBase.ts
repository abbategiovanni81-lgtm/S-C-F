## 🤖 AI ENGINES - Understanding Your Creative Tools

SocialCommand uses cutting-edge AI models from OpenAI. Here's what powers your content creation:

### GPT-Image-1 (Image Generation & Editing)

**What is GPT-Image-1?**
OpenAI's newest image model, released after DALL-E 3. It's our default for all image generation and editing.

**Why GPT-Image-1 over DALL-E 3?**
- **20% Cheaper** - Lower cost per image generation
- **4× Faster** - Generates images in seconds, not minutes
- **Supports Editing** - Edit existing images (change backgrounds, add/remove elements)
- **Supports Variations** - Create multiple versions of the same image
- **Better Text Rendering** - Handles text in images more reliably

**What can I do with GPT-Image-1?**
- Generate new images from text descriptions
- Edit existing images (inpainting/outpainting)
- Create variations of images you like
- Remove or replace backgrounds
- Add or remove objects from images

**Typical costs:** ~$0.02-0.04 per image (billed through your OpenAI API key)

---

### Sora 2 (Video Generation)

**What is Sora 2?**
OpenAI's video generation model - create videos from text, images, or remix Sora-generated videos.

**What can Sora 2 do?**
- **Text-to-Video** - Describe a scene, get a video (up to 20 seconds)
- **Image-to-Video** - Animate any still image into motion
- **Video Remix** - Transform Sora-generated videos with new styles or effects

**Important Remix Limitation:** Remix ONLY works with Sora-generated videos (requires a Sora video ID). You cannot remix arbitrary video files, MP4 uploads, or YouTube clips. You must first generate a video with Sora, then use that video's ID to remix it.

**When should I use Sora 2?**
- Creating B-roll and stock-style footage
- Animating product photos for social posts
- Generating video content when you don't have footage
- Generating a video and then remixing it with fresh perspectives

**Why OpenAI TTS?**
- **Budget-Friendly** - 5-10× cheaper than ElevenLabs (~$15/1M chars vs ~$200/1M chars)
- **Natural Sounding** - High-quality voices that don't sound robotic
- **Multiple Voices** - Choose from various voice styles (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
- **Fast Generation** - Get voiceovers in seconds

**When should I use OpenAI TTS vs ElevenLabs?**
| Feature | OpenAI TTS | ElevenLabs |

| Voice Cloning | No | Yes |
| Voice Quality | Great | Premium |
| Best For | Volume content, budget-conscious | Voice clones, ultra-premium |

**Recommendation:** Use OpenAI TTS for most voiceovers. Switch to ElevenLabs when you need voice cloning or ultra-premium quality for specific projects.

---

### "Which AI engine should I use?"

**For Images:**
- GPT-Image-1 is your default - fast, affordable, and supports editing
