# SocialCommand Platform - Complete Help Guide

## GETTING STARTED

### "I want to start making content - where do I begin?"
Great! Here's the recommended path:
1. First, create a Brand Brief - this tells the AI about your brand, audience, and style
2. Then decide what type of content you want to create (short videos, images, carousels, etc.)
3. Use the AI tools to generate your content
4. Review, approve, and schedule to your connected accounts

### "What type of content should I make?"
It depends on your platform:
- **TikTok/Reels/Shorts**: 15-60 second videos work best. Hook viewers in first 3 seconds.
- **Instagram Feed**: Carousels (multiple slides) get highest engagement
- **YouTube**: Both short-form (Shorts) and long-form (5+ minutes) work well
- **LinkedIn/Twitter**: Text posts with images or short clips
