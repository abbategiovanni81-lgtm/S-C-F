## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "My video generation is taking too long"
Video generation typically takes 1-3 minutes. If it's taking longer:
- Check your internet connection
- Try a shorter script (under 60 seconds)
- For complex scenes, break into smaller parts

### "The AI voice doesn't sound right"
- Try a different voice from the library
- Add punctuation for natural pauses
- Keep sentences short and conversational
- Avoid ALL CAPS (sounds robotic)

### "My content isn't generating"
- Make sure you have a Brand Brief selected
- Check your usage quota isn't exhausted
- Try refreshing the page
- If persistent, contact support

### "Social Listening isn't finding results"
- Try broader keywords
- Check you've selected platforms
- Some platforms have rate limits - try again in a few minutes
- Use fewer platforms at once for faster results

### "I can't connect my social account"
- Make sure you're logged into that platform in your browser
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Check you have the right permissions
- Some platforms require business/creator accounts
