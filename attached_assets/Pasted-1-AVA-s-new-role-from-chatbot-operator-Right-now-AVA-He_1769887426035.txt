1. AVA’s new role: from chatbot → operator

Right now AVA =

“Here’s what you can do next”

What you want is AVA =

“I’m doing this with you — and sometimes for you”

The rule

Every major decision screen should be triggerable by AVA, not just buttons.

That means:
	•	Cards still exist (visual clarity)
	•	But AVA can:
	•	Select a card
	•	Advance the flow
	•	Populate inputs
	•	Run generation
	•	Rewind content back to edit

Think of AVA as a stateful assistant with permissions, not a chat window.

⸻

2. Mobile-native flow (rewritten cleanly, step by step)

I’ll rewrite exactly what you described — but in a mobile-first assistant flow, not page hopping.

⸻

ENTRY POINT (after Brand Brief → Generate)

Instead of “Next page”, you land in a full-screen decision moment:

AVA says:
“What are we creating right now?”

Two large cards (center screen):
Option A

Create One Post
small, fast, tactical

Option B

Build My Content Plan
structured, multi-post, scheduled

(Names below — these are placeholders)

AVA can also accept:
	•	“Just one reel”
	•	“Full month”
	•	“I want TikToks only”

⸻

3. Single Content Path (clean, focused, fast)

Step 1 — Format choice

AVA asks:

“What format should we make?”

Cards:
	•	Reel / Short
	•	Static Post
	•	Carousel
	•	Story
	•	Long-form Video
	•	Ad

(AVA can auto-recommend one and pre-select it)

⸻

Step 2 — Creation method fork

AVA:

“Do you want speed or control?”

Cards:
	•	Start From Scratch (AI-led)
	•	Use a Proven Template

⸻

If Templates

You already nailed this.

UI rules:
	•	Full-screen grid (Beat / Tempify style)
	•	Tabs: Trending / Niche / Platform / Length
	•	Tap = preview
	•	AVA overlay explains why a template works

AVA can say:

“This one performs well for travel + hooks in the first 1.5s.”

⸻

If From Scratch

No blank screens.

AVA immediately generates:
	•	Content idea
	•	Hook
	•	Script
	•	Caption
	•	Hashtags
	•	Optional voiceover text

All appear as editable cards, not a long text block.

From here:
	•	Upload media or
	•	Generate media
	•	Open editor
	•	Edit & Merge
	•	Compare versions
	•	Score updates live

Bad score → AVA suggests fixes, not just numbers.

When score passes threshold:

“This is ready to post. Want to schedule or tweak further?”

⸻

4. Full Content Path (this is where SCF wins)

This is strong — you’re not overthinking it.

⸻

Step 1 — Planning choice

AVA:

“How do you want to plan this?”

Cards:
	•	Let AI Build the Plan
	•	I’ll Choose What to Post

⸻

Step 2 — AI Plan Generation (no content yet)

Behind the scenes (as you described):
	•	Brand brief
	•	Keywords
	•	Example accounts
	•	Social listening
	•	Viral topic analysis
	•	Platform requirements

But the UI only shows the outcome, not the process.

⸻

Step 3 — Content Plan Review Board

This is critical.

You land on a content card board, not generation.

Each card shows:
	•	Platform
	•	Format
	•	Topic
	•	Goal (growth / sales / authority)
	•	Status: AI / Library / User Upload

User actions:
	•	Tick to generate
	•	Swap content type
	•	Edit script
	•	Add reference media
	•	Jump back to Brand Brief (inline, not navigation)

AVA guides:

“I’d generate these 9 and let you upload these 3.”

⸻

Step 4 — Batch Generate (async)

User taps:
Generate Content

AVA:

“This will take a bit. I’ll handle it.”

No spinner. No blocking.

⸻

Step 5 — Return to a Completed Board

24 hours later (or sooner):
	•	All cards populated
	•	Each item:
	•	Preview
	•	Score
	•	Edit
	•	Regenerate
	•	Replace media

Unsupported platforms:
	•	Auto-saved to device
	•	Clearly labelled “Manual Upload”

There’s also:
	•	A visual plan image (timeline/calendar view)
	•	Checklist mode for manual posting

⸻

5. Naming fixes (important, but not urgent)

Here are better, clearer, non-cringe names.

Instead of:
	•	Create 1 piece of content
	•	Create full socials

Use:

Option A
	•	Quick Post
	•	Single Post
	•	One-Off Content

Option B
	•	Content Plan
	•	Social Schedule
	•	Full Content Cycle
	•	Build My Feed
